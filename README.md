# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Git
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a Hand Gesture Recognition system for human–computer interaction using machine learning and computer vision techniques. The system captures hand gestures through a camera, processes the visual input, and classifies different hand gestures in real time.

The primary objective of this project is to provide a touch-free and intuitive interaction method that can be used in applications such as virtual control systems, assistive technologies, and smart interfaces. Image preprocessing techniques are applied to enhance gesture features, followed by feature extraction and classification using machine learning models.

The project demonstrates how visual data can be effectively converted into meaningful commands, making human–machine communication more natural and efficient. This work was developed as an academic project and includes practical implementation, testing, and result analysis.
